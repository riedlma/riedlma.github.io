    Hello, my name is Martin and I'm currently working as a senior data scientist at Knecon Technology GmbH.
</p>
<p>
Before studying computer science, I completed an apprenticeship as 
	software developer at the BASF SE. During that time I realized that I want to learn more about 
	developing software and wanted to become a researcher. For this, I studied computer science at the 
	HS Mannheim and completed with a diploma and a master degree. During that time I also had a class
	about machine learning, which attracted all my attention (and still does!). In June 2011 I started a PhD in the 
	field of computational linguistics under the supervision of Chris Biemann at the TU Darmstadt and 
	finished my Dr.rer.nat degree in February 2016. In October 2016 I moved with Chris Biemann to 
	the University of Hamburg and worked as a Postdoctoral researcher. From October 2017 I joined Sebastian Pado's group at the IMS in Stuttgart
	and worked on a digital humanity project. 
	In July 2019 I started working in industry and worked as a data scientist at Heidelberg Druckmaschinen AG defining and implementing
	a concept for a data warehouse usind cloud-based technologies. From January 2020
	to February 2023 I was working as a senior data scientist at Diamant Software. There, I worked on several AI topics for optimizing 
	the accounting software. Since March 2023 I am working for Knecon Technology GmbH focusing as a senior data scientist.

		Besides research in CL, I love spending time with my family, training for triathlon as well as playing trumpet, piano and brewing crazy beer styles.
