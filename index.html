    Hello, my name is Martin and I'm currently working as a data scientist at Heidelberg Druckmaschinen AG.
</p>
<p>
Before studying computer science, I completed an apprenticeship as 
	software developer at the BASF SE. During that time I realized that I want to learn more about 
	developing software and wanted to become a researcher. For this, I studied computer science at the 
	HS Mannheim and completed with a diploma and a master degree. In June 2011 I started a PhD in the 
	field of computational linguistics under the supervision of Chris Biemann at the TU Darmstadt and 
	finished my Dr.rer.nat degree in February 2016. In October 2016 I moved with 
	<a href="https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html">Chris Biemann</a> to 
	the University of Hamburg and worked as a Postdoctoral researcher on the 
	<a href="https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/research/semsch.html">SEMSCH</a> (Semantic 
	Methods for Computer-supported Writing Aid) project. From October 2017 I joined the <a href ="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/arbeitsgruppen/tcl/index.html">TCL group</a> 
	and was working on the <a href="http://oceanicexchanges.org/">Oceanic Exchanges</a> project. Since 
	July 2019 I joined industry and work as a data scientist at Heidelberg Druckmaschinen AG. 
</p>

		Besides research in CL, I love spending time with my family, playing trumpet, piano, guitarlele, 
		riding my motorcycle, brewing beer, parkour, jogging and climbing.
