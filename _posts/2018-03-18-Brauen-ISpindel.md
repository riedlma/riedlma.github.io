As brewing beer is one of my passions, I was thinking about tuning/extending my equipment. After upgrading to 50 liters is no option due to space issues, I decided to build the [iSpindel](https://github.com/universam1/iSpindel). The iSpindel can be used for recording the fermentation of beer. After reading the instructions, I ordered the [DIY iSpindel](https://www.3d-mechatronics.de/de/ispindel-diy-set_151.html) set.

After receiving the electric components, I realised that I might have overestimated my soldering skills. Last tim I might have been soldering similar tiny parts goes back to 2002 during my apprenticeship. However, my joy for that project voted down my concerns.
